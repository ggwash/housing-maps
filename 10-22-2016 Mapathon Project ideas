Building Permits in DC
http://data.octo.dc.gov/Metadata.aspx?id=5
http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets?q=*permits&sort_by=relevance 
Shows what work is being done in DC
Can we use this to map Pop-ups across city?
Exploring Building permits over time would be interesting -  what is getting built when... 
What other patterns emerge here that are interesting?

Property sales data in DC http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/b1bc741677c04a59a862250d1290a8ad_57
Who is buying what (condo, single family home, row home, etc), when?
Can we watch fluctuations of price happen here over time?

CAMA data
A huge amount of residential data - building materials, building dates, structure, etc - all for housing in district - http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/c5fb3fbe4c694a59a6eef7bf5f8bc49a_25?uiTab=table
Where are the tall buildings actually?  What does DC look like in terms of # of stories on each plot of land?
There’s a lot you can do with this - see Kate R’s map for an example- http://greatergreaterwashington.org/post/32508/this-map-shows-what-all-of-dcs-houses-are-made-of/
